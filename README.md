# Opal
A password manager for an Apache Tomcat Server.


## Development Note
This branch is currently not working or stable.

Opal is designed to be a secure password manager, however, not every commit will have this in mind. Release tags should be
the most secure variants of this project.

All changes will be pushed into the "master" branch until a tested, stable, version implementing the minimum feature set can
be produced. Then, large additions, untested code, or new features will be commited to a features branch until testing proves
they are worthy of being merged back into the master branch.


## Description
Opal is a password manager designed to run in a server environment. Future features such as a compatible Android app are
planned.


## Compiling and Using
Edit password in src/main/sql/quickStartScript.sql and run as MySQL root. This script creates a database for our program and
an user account authorized to manipulate it. Switch the account we just created in your MySQL shell.

Now run src/main/sql/initTablesAndProcs.sql. This script creates a couple of tables and stored procedures necessary to the 
functionality of opal. Soon, I will implement an install option that does this automatically on the first run.

Gradle handles dependencies (MySQL Connector J, and JUnit) for this project.
